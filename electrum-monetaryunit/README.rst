Getting started
===============

Electrum-MUE is a pure python application. If you want to use the
Qt interface, install the Qt dependencies::

    sudo apt-get install python-qt4

If you downloaded the official package (tar.gz), you can run
Electrum-MUE from its root directory, without installing it on your
system; all the python dependencies are included in the 'packages'
directory. To run Electrum-MUE from its root directory, just do::

    ./electrum-monetaryunit

You can also install Electrum-MUE on your system, by running this command::

    python setup.py install

This will download and install the Python dependencies used by
Electrum-MUE, instead of using the 'packages' directory.

If you cloned the git repository, you need to compile extra files
before you can run Electrum-MUE. Read the next section, "Development
Version".



Development version
===================

Check out the code from Github::

    git clone https://github.com/akhavr/electrum-monetaryunit
    cd electrum-monetaryunit

Run install (this should install dependencies)::

    python setup.py install

Compile the icons file for Qt::

    sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools
    pyrcc4 icons.qrc -o gui/qt/icons_rc.py

Compile the protobuf description file::

    sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
    protoc --proto_path=lib/ --python_out=lib/ lib/paymentrequest.proto

Create translations (optional)::

    sudo apt-get install python-pycurl gettext
    ./contrib/make_locale




Creating Binaries
=================


To create binaries, create the 'packages' directory::

    ./contrib/make_packages

This directory contains the python dependencies used by Electrum.

Mac OS X
